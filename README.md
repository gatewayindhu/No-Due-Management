1. Project Overview
The No Due Management System is a software application designed to efficiently track and manage pending dues for students in educational institutions. It streamlines the process of collecting dues, updating records, and generating analytics for administrative staff.

2. Objectives
Automate and digitize the tracking of student dues.
Enable the addition, deletion, updating, and searching of student dues records.
Provide data analytics and visualization for better decision-making.
3. Features
Student Records Management: Add, update, and delete student information along with pending dues.
Due Payment Tracking: Record payments and clear dues efficiently.
Search Functionality: Quick search feature based on student ID, name, or department.
Data Export: Export data to Excel for offline storage and reporting.
Data Analytics: Generate visual analytics (bar charts, pie charts, histograms) for financial insights.
Authentication: Optional admin user authentication for secure access (future enhancement).
4. Functional Modules
User Interface:

Built using Tkinter for desktop-based user interaction.
